# Eric React Template
This is an enhanced React Typescript template, initially based on the [MUI Free Dashboard Template](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/v5.15.12/docs/data/material/getting-started/templates/dashboard).

## Getting Started

To use this template, you can either download it directly or clone the repository from [here](https://github.com/onlineeric/eric-react-template.git).

Once you have the template, follow these steps to get it up and running:

```bash
npm install  # Install the necessary dependencies
npm start    # Start the development server
```

## About this template

This template uses Material UI with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). It includes several key packages:

- `@mui/material`: Material UI's core components
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction): The default style engine in Material UI v5
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/): A state management tool that allows for efficient data flow in your application
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter

These packages, along with their peer dependencies, are all included, providing a robust foundation for your React project.

ESLint and Prettier are integrated to ensure consistent code formatting and to help identify potential issues early in the development process.

## The idea behind the template
In my demo project, available on [my Github page](https://github.com/onlineeric), I aim to use a React Single Page App as the UI to showcase my skills.

This template serves as a base from which I plan to add more features. It's an ideal starting point for any new React project.
