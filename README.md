# Eric Demo Project Site
Welcome! This repository is a personal project, where I, Eric Cheng, am demonstrating my Node Js React and web frontend knowledge.

This UI is a Single Page App (SPA) built using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI.  
The backend should connent to my other demo projects (work in progress), which are built using .Net C#, and GoLang.  

For this Recat Project, I have used the following technologies:

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-007ACC?logo=typescript&logoColor=white&style=flat)
![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Redux-764ABC?logo=redux&logoColor=white&style=flat)
![Material-UI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Material--UI-0081CB?logo=material-ui&logoColor=white&style=flat)

## Getting Started

To use this template, you can either download it directly or clone the repository from [here](https://github.com/onlineeric/eric-demo-react.git).

Once you have the template, follow these steps to get it up and running:

```bash
npm install  # Install the necessary dependencies
npm start    # Start the development server
```

## About this React App

This React App clone from my another project [Eric Recat Template](https://github.com/onlineeric/eric-demo-react.git). This is developed in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). It includes several key packages:  
- `@mui/material`: Material UI's core components
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction): The default style engine in Material UI v5
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/): A state management tool that allows for efficient data flow in your application
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter

These packages, along with their peer dependencies, are all included, providing a robust foundation for your React project.

ESLint and Prettier are integrated to ensure consistent code formatting and to help identify potential issues early in the development process.

## The idea behind the template
In my demo project, available on [my Github page](https://github.com/onlineeric), I aim to use a React Single Page App as the UI to showcase my skills.
