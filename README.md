# Eric Demo Project Site
Welcome! I'm Eric Cheng, this repository is my personal demo project to showcase my full stack and AI development skills.

This UI is a Single Page App (SPA) built using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI.
The backend connented to my other demo projects, which are built using .Net C#, and GoLang.  

For this Recat Project, I have used the following technologies:

## About this React App

This React App clone from my another project [Eric Recat Template](https://github.com/onlineeric/eric-demo-react.git). This is developed in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). It includes several key packages:  
- `@mui/material`: Material UI's core components
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction): The default style engine in Material UI v5
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/): A state management tool that allows for efficient data flow in your application
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter

These packages, along with their peer dependencies, are all included, providing a robust foundation for your React project.

ESLint and Prettier are integrated to ensure consistent code formatting and to help identify potential issues early in the development process.
